      <h2>What is ReleaseKit?</h2>
      <p>ReleaseKit is the first complete suite of tools designed to simplify and improve the release process of shortcuts for developers and create a more robust, helpful, and feature-rich experience for end-users.</p>
      <h2>When will ReleaseKit be available?</h2>
      <p>A few of the tools are already available individually on RoutineHub, such as miCloud, CloudCuts Release Notes (which is listed under the title "ReleaseKit"), and both Screens and Docs, which are available, albeit in a somewhat limited capacity, under the title "PromoKit". I will provide links to these shortcuts at a later date. I have slowly been incorporating features related to ReleaseKit in each new version of these shortcuts for some time now and the underlying foundation which ties them all together is mostly intact.<br /><br />Aside from that, the short answer is, 'I don't know'. Trying to re-configure completed, stand-alone shortcuts into a unified suite of tools which are dependent upon each other and to provide a seamless and non-fragmented experience for end-users has, admittedly, been challenging and time-consuming, especially considering I am the sole developer working on ReleaseKit. However, it is coming along and I will continue to provide periodic updates to the community throughout the process.</p> 
      <h2>Why are the shortcuts listed individually (rather than collectively)?</h2>
      <p>Simply because the idea came <em>after</em> the shortcuts. I didn't develop the concept for ReleaseKit until seeing all the release-oriented developer tools I had already released and deciding to package these individual tools together and create ReleaseKit.</p>

        <h3>&#9729;<a href="https://github.com/MrTWrecks0208/ReleaseKit/miCloud">&nbsp;miCloud</a></h3>
      </div>
      <p>miCloud is a storage solution and version control system for Shortcuts which serves as the underlying structure and foundation for ReleaseKit. miCloud groups shortcuts into two categories, 'Builds' and 'Releases'. Each Build and Release is subgrouped into 'Major Versions', then further subgrouped into 'Minor Versions'. miCloud creates a folder for each shortcut saved. A dictionary including general details & metadata of the shortcut and also the user is also created. All data for a shortcut is stored in its respective folder. All shortcuts included in ReleaseKit pull data from miCloud.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Release Notes is, as the name suggests, for creating release notes. Release Notes are documents which accompany the release of a version of software. Release notes help to inform end-users and keep them aware of any changes in a new version of a shortcut. Release notes typically include new features, bug fixes, and enhancements/improvements. In addition to these categories, Release Notes also includes sections for additional resources and general notes.</p>

      <p>Developers can now create their own avatars with ReleaseKit. There are a few different styles to choose from, allowing everyone to create avatars which are inclusive and which represent them! The avatars created are tied to the user and can be used anywhere-not just in Shortcuts!</p>

        <h3>&#128279;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/MrTWrecks0208/ReleaseKit/cloudcuts">CloudCuts</a></h3>
      </div>
      <p>CloudCuts is a new and innovate way for shortcut developers to share their shortcuts. Currently, few options exist to share shortcuts with the general public, and the options which do exist, have become slow and unresponsive and suffer from frequent outages. The downtime from these outages severely impacts developers and limits the potential reach of their work. Not only are users unable to download shortcuts, but, due to how the sites are designed, there's a chance they may never even see the shortcuts at all.</p><br /><p>Enter CloudCuts</p>.<br /><p>CloudCuts creates screens which display shortcuts along with descriptions and download links for each shortcut. Developers can then add their CloudCuts screen to a shortcut (or all of their shortcuts). When users run the shortcut, the CloudCuts screen will display and bring attention to other shortcuts created by the developer. Users are then able to download any of the shortcuts they'd like from right inside the shortcut they're running. In this way, CloudCuts acts similarly to a hosting site or a link-aggregation site such as Linktree. With CloudCuts, the status of popular shortcut-hosting sites is almost entirely irrelevant. As long as users have just one of your shortcuts, they have access to all of them (or as many as you'd like them to have access to).</p>
